A blank line matches no files, so it can serve as a separator for readability.



A line starting with # serves as a comment. Put a backslash ("\") in front of the first hash for patterns that begin with a hash.



Trailing spaces are ignored unless they are quoted with backslash ("\").



An optional prefix "!" which negates the pattern; any matching file excluded by a previous pattern will become included again. It is not possible to re-include a file if a parent directory of that file is excluded. Git doesn’t list excluded directories for performance reasons, so any patterns on contained files have no effect, no matter where they are defined. Put a backslash ("\") in front of the first "!" for patterns that begin with a literal "!", for example, "\!important!.txt".



The slash / is used as the directory separator. Separators may occur at the beginning, middle or end of the .gitignore search pattern.



If there is a separator at the beginning or middle (or both) of the pattern, then the pattern is relative to the directory level of the particular .gitignore file itself. Otherwise the pattern may also match at any level below the .gitignore level.



If there is a separator at the end of the pattern then the pattern will only match directories, otherwise the pattern can match both files and directories.



For example, a pattern doc/frotz/ matches doc/frotz directory, but not a/doc/frotz directory; however frotz/ matches frotz and a/frotz that is a directory (all paths are relative from the .gitignore file).



An asterisk "*" matches anything except a slash. The character "?" matches any one character except "/". The range notation, e.g. [a-zA-Z], can be used to match one of the characters in a range. See fnmatch(3) and the FNM_PATHNAME flag for a more detailed description
